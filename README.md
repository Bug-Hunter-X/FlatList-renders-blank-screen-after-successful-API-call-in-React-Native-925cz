# React Native FlatList Blank Screen Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native renders a blank screen after a successful API call. The issue is intermittent and appears to be specific to Android devices.  The code fetches data correctly, but the FlatList fails to display the items.

## Bug Description

The application fetches data from an API using `fetch`. The data is successfully retrieved and parsed into a JSON object. However, the FlatList component remains blank despite the `data` state being populated.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Run the provided code on an Android device or emulator.
2. Observe that the FlatList remains blank, even though the console logs show that data has been successfully fetched.

## Solution

The provided solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the component re-renders after the data is updated. This is achieved by adding a unique key to each item in the data array.
